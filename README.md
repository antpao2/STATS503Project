STATS 503 Project: Predicting Playoff Success Based On Regular Season Performance

I worked alongside 3 of my classmates to produce this project for a final project in our Graduate Level Machine Learning Class. I primarily focused on data gathering, manipulation, offensive EDA, and bulding our models. I have also attached our report

Completed during first year of Graduate Studies (March/April of 2023)
